## PyChain Ledger
### Introduction

As the lead developer on the decentralized finance team at one of the largest banks in the world, my task was to build a blockchain-based ledger system with a user-friendly web interface. The main objective was to provide a secure platform for partner banks to conduct financial transactions and verify the integrity of data in the ledger.

The use of blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent system for financial transactions, making it an ideal choice for decentralized finance. The ledger system is built using Python programming language and is designed to allow partner banks to transfer money between senders and receivers securely. The ledger system also includes features to maintain the integrity of data and ensure that all transactions are recorded accurately.

The system is designed to allow for easy integration with existing banking systems, making it easier for partner banks to adopt and use the system. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily navigate the system and perform transactions with ease.

The development of this blockchain-based ledger system is a significant step towards modernizing the banking industry and providing a more secure and transparent system for financial transactions.

### Requirements
To use PyChain, you must have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or later
Streamlit library
Installation
To install PyChain, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt
Install the required libraries using the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application using the command: streamlit run pychain.py

### Instructions
PyChain comes with a simple and user-friendly interface built with the Streamlit library. Once the application is running, you can perform the following actions:

1. Add a Block
To add a new block to the chain, enter the block data in the text box labeled "Block Data" and click the "Add Block" button. This will create a new block and add it to the chain.

2. View the Chain
To view the entire blockchain, click the "View the Chain" button. This will display all the blocks in the blockchain.

3. Validate the Chain
To validate the blockchain, click the "Validate the Chain" button. This will check the blockchain for any invalid blocks and display the results.
